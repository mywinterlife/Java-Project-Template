# Java Project Template

Clean, reusable starter template for Java projects in intellij.  
Designed for IntelliJ IDEA and structured for clear object-oriented development.

This template includes:
- Standard Java `src` layout
- Organized package structure (Enums, Interfaces, ObjectClasses, ExecutableClasses)
- A starter `Program.java` with a runnable `main` method
- A `.gitignore` customized for IntelliJ + Java
- MIT License

This structure is inspired by practical OOP patterns used in real projects  
(e.g., card games, simulations, automation frameworks, and service managers).

Running the Program
Open IntelliJ and run the file:
---

Using This Template:

1. Click **Use this template** at the top of the repository on GitHub.
2. Choose **Create a new repository**.
3. Name your project (e.g., `MyProject`, `InventorySystem`, `GameEngine`, etc.).
4. Clone the new repository to your machine:
   - **IntelliJ IDEA > Get from VCS > paste your repo URL**
5. Open the project. IntelliJ will automatically recognize:
   - `src/` as your source root  
   - Folder structure as packages  
   - `Program.java` as a valid entry point  

Start coding.

Project Structure / Getting Started / Recommended Usage:
src/ExecutableClasses/Program.java
It contains a basic `main` method you can replace or rename as your project evolves.
Use this template when starting any new Java project:

- School assignments  
- Personal Java practice  
- Automation framework prototypes  
- OOP learning exercises  
- Game engines  
- Utility scripts  
- Technical assessments  

The structure helps maintain clean separation of concerns:
- **Enums** for constants  
- **Interfaces** for abstractions  
- **ObjectClasses** for concrete implementations  
- **Participants** for role-based entities  
- **ExecutableClasses** for anything with a `main()`

IntelliJ Notes

This template is optimized for IntelliJ IDEA:

- `.idea/` is excluded via `.gitignore`
- `.iml` files are not tracked
- `out/` is ignored (compiler output)
- `src/` is immediately recognized as a source root

Just clone → open → code.
